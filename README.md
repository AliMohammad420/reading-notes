### -  What is a "Component" ?
<p> A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components and exporting high-level interface, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.</p>

### - What are the characteristics of a component?
> Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.
>
> Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.
>
> Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.
>
> Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.
>
> Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.
>
> Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.
