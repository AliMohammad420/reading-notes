**nosql vs sql**

 **Diffrence Between SQL & NOSQL**<br>
SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.<br>
SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.<br>
SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.<br>
SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.<br>

1) Highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined 
2) Microsoft Access uses sql to build tables.
3) Simple schema.
4) MongoDB
5) Document based database 
6) Apache Cassandra

1) Structured Query Language
2) Database structured to recognize relations between stored items of information.
3) The relational model means that the logical data structures
4) The database schema is the structure of a database described in a formal language supported by the database management system.
5) A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. 
6) NoSQL databases store data in documents rather than relational tables
7) MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.
8) While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions.
9) Compatibility issues with SQL instructions. New databases use their own characteristics in the query language and they're not yet 100% compatible with the SQL used in relational databases. Support for work query issues in a NoSQL database is more complicated. Lack of standarization.
