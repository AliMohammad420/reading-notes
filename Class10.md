**Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack**

1) The call() method is a predefined JavaScript method. 
2) only one
3) Last In First Out

5) excessively deep or infinite recursion

 **JavaScript error messages**
 
 1) an error when a variable that doesn't exist (or hasn't yet been initialized) in the current scope is referenced 
 2) occurs when trying to interpret code that is not syntactically valid. 
 3) thrown when trying to pass a value as an argument to a function that does not allow a range that includes the value. 
 4) an error when an operation could not be performed, typically (but not exclusively) when a value is not of the expected type
 5) In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code. At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values. 
 6) identifying coding errors at various stages of the operating system or application development.
