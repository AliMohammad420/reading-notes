**Functional Programming Concepts**

1) Functional programming is a programming paradigm a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs  that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

2) To understand how it's pure, It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic), It does not cause any observable side effects.

3) Pure functions are much easier to read and reason about. All relevant inputs and dependencies are provided as parameters, so no effects are observed that alter variables outside of the set of inputs.

4) Its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

5) If a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

**Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()**

1) A module in JavaScript is just a file containing related code.

2) The require() method is used to load and cache JavaScript modules.

3) To include functions defined in another file in Node.js, we need to import the module. we will use the require keyword at the top of the file.

4) Access to module features is export them.
